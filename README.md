# BASIC-80 MBASIC Programs Collection

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of BASIC-80 MBASIC programs, including games and various applications, that I wrote over the years. These programs were primarily optimized for the Kaypro computer but may work on other systems with little to no modification.

## Historical Context
MBASIC, also known as BASIC-80, was an early and influential implementation of the BASIC programming language developed by Microsoft in 1975. It became one of the most widely used programming languages in the late 1970s and early 1980s, running on various 8-bit systems, including the popular CP/M operating system.
The Kaypro, for which these programs were optimized, was a portable microcomputer introduced in 1982. It ran CP/M and was known for its solid construction and bundled software, making it a popular choice for both business and personal use.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:

* Games
* Statistics programs
* Benchmarking tools 
* Business applications

Each program is provided as a separate file with a .bas extension.

## Usage
To run these programs:

### Step 1: Initialize CP/M
Ensure that the CP/M operating system is running on your machine.

### Step 2: Start MBASIC
Insert yoiur disk with MBASIC-80. At the CP/M command prompt, type 'MBASIC' and press Enter.

### Step 3: Load the Program
If you have a specific BASIC program file to run, type RUN "MYPROG.BAS". You can also type LOAD "MYPROG.BAS" and then type RUN after the program has loaded.

### Step 4: Run the Program
1. Once your program is either loaded into memory or typed in, start execution by typing RUN and pressing Enter.
2. If you want to start execution from a specific line number, type RUN followed by the line number (e.g., RUN 100) and press Enter.

### Step 5: Exit MBASIC
To exit MBASIC and return to the CP/M command prompt, type SYSTEM and press Enter.

Note: While these programs were optimized for the Kaypro, they may run on other CP/M systems or BASIC-80 compatible environments with minimal modifications.

## Compatibility
These programs should be compatible with:

* Kaypro CP/M computers
* CP/M or DOS systems running MBASIC
* Some may work on early IBM PC compatibles with appropriate BASIC interpreters (e.g., BASICA, GW-BASIC)

Minor adjustments may be necessary for systems other than the Kaypro.

## Contributing
Contributions to this collection are welcome! If you have BASIC-80 programs to add or improvements to existing ones, please feel free to submit a pull request.
